        About Me
    </h2>
        <p>
            I am a second-year Computer Engineering student with a passion for technology, 
            problem-solving, and innovation. As a beginner developer, I have experience 
            in Python and a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, with a growing interest 
            in web development and system design. I am eager to explore software and hardware solutions 
            that have real-world impact, particularly in the fields of system development and 
            emerging technologies.
